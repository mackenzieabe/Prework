        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p> 
            Billie Holiday was discovered at a club in Harlem, NY when she was eighteen. Lady Day, as she was nicknamed, would go on to become one of the most well known names in jazz.
            She had a successful career for twenty years but, sadly, it was cut short due to addiction. She passed away in 1959 but her legacy lives on through her music.
